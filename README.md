PhotoEdit
=========

This is a website, that offers a photo editor. 
Most of the functions are based on what I was taught in university.

Features
--------

Currently it offers manipulation of brightness, contrast, saturation,
hue, grey shades.
Also the user can imply some predefined filters, to show the red, green
or blue channel. Also one can create a negative. In addition the user
can apply own filters or use a few predefined ones.
Additionally the image can be resized, which currently is quite buggy.

The project also included some threading using webworkers, but it ended
up to be to slow. More features may be added in the future.
